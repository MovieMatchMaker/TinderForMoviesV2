      content="MovieMatchMaker is a quick and simple way to find a movie. Inspired by the Tinder interface, the system allows you to field potential movie matches, being suggested more and more relevant movies as you go.
      Swiping right on a movie tells us that you would like to see similar films. Swiping left tells us you aren`t interested.
      Sign up, get swiping, and find your match today."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
